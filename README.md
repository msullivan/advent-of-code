# advent-of-code
My hacky advent of code solutions. Generally not good code.

Many of these were originally written very fast, to try to make the
leaderboard. I'm somewhat surprised that I've wound up instinctively
reaching for Haskell so often.

I'm somewhat inconsistent about whether the files here represent the
very first original code that I wrote to solve the problem, or
something somewhat cleaned up. I think what I am going to try to do is
commit my first versions without change, so it is available in the
history, and then if I feel like it, commit a cleaned up version with
generally the same approach.
